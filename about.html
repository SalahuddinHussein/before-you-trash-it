      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This site came about while I was moving. Packing is a big process, and I was trying to simplify things by getting rid of as much as possible. I'm a pretty environmentally-conscious person, and I try to throw away as little trash as possible. This got me thinking that I should make it as easy as possible to figure out what you can bring to donate, and where to bring it.</p>
      <p>So please, use this tool and share with your friends. We live in a dying world - it's our responsibility to divert as much as we can away from landfills. When someone says "throw it away", just remember - there is no "away".</p>
